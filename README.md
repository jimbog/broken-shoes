### Fix an Express app... as a team!

In this independent practice lab, you'll work with your assigned teams to create a working Express application by adding code to an existing project and using Git/GitHub to collaborate. This is meant to give you a little taste of what's to come during your Project 3 work sprint, where you will work with a team which we've selected for you. You have been given most of the app in the starter code.

Your job is to find and fix the errors that exist in this starter app. There are **7** errors total, so make sure to catch them all!


**The team that fixes this app will be able to have full CRUD funcitonalty when working with your app in Postman or cURL.**

To start:

- The team lead should fork and clone the Candies App repo to their GitHub
- The team members should fork and clone the team lead's repo, so they have a local copy and can start working
- Rely on the *Git Workflow Cheatsheet* ["Programmer & Manager"](https://github.com/mer8/broken-candies/blob/master/git_workflow_cheatsheet.md#our-workflows) workflow for this lab
